# AuctionHouse
Contract enabling anyone to set up NFT auctions for certain time-frames. Bringing business to the Auction also nets the customer rewards. Any completed action like winning an auction or putting up an item for auction nets reward tokens which can then be used to enter special/vip auctions or to set up priority auctions. They can also be redeemed to not pay the auction fees. These rewards are intendedd to make participating in these auctions an engaging and rewarding activity and in the future when I implement an ecosystem regarding the same they can have increased functionality. Regarding the scope of this project it is still unfinished as I re-think t he direction I want to take it to.
